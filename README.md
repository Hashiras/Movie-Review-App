## FAQ

#### Is the project complete and functional?

This is just a practice exercise that we conducted that is aimed into finding the best technique to utilize six hours of development. In short **No**



#### Why can't I see any movies?

As previously mentioned, this project is not completely finish as the only finished function here are the modules that a user can acccess. NO ADMIN SIDE which means there is no way for anyone besides us to populate the list.
